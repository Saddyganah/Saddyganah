Penetration Tester

I am an experienced web application penetration tester with a strong focus on building and applying structured testing methodologies. I use a combination of manual testing and selective automation to identify vulnerabilities, uncover implementation weaknesses, and validate real‑world security impact.

# Objective
I work to fully understand how a web application is built and behaves, then methodically test its inputs, flows, and state handling to uncover weaknesses rooted in implementation, logic, or configuration. I prioritize depth over noise and only automate where it meaningfully supports validation and discovery.
